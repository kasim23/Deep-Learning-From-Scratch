This is where I implement all deep learning algorithms from scratch. The idea is to really understand what is going on underneath the hood and I use only Python and numpy in some cases to really build these architectures from the ground-up and in other cases some external libraries have been used. The goal is to look beyond than just calling .fit() and .predict() and hopefully write my own version of such functions. Let's Get To It!!!
